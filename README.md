## Welcome to my Geographical new project!

## This project focuses in a few things:

### We need to locate our new Gaming company somewhere in this world, so we need some criteria to follow in order to satisfy our workers and maybe clients!

#### This is what we've done to locate our new company:

- First, we focused our view in Silicon Valley, well known already for being one of the best places to give birth to a startup.

- Secondly, we got access to a database of our own with more than 18k companies from all over the world, so we also focused our search in the area of San Jos√© (CA).

- Next, we obtained all the successful companies that have already raised 1 Million dollars at least.

- We got some matches and located some of them in a beautiful map with the folium module.

- Then, we started to search for vegan restaurants because our workers like them! So we used the Google Places API to find some of them. We chose one and kept going!

- After finding the restaurant, we carried on looking for some schools nearby from our chosen location, we found a Highschool within 10km radius! Perfect for dropping the kids before going to work and closer enough to have our workers not worrying about being late to work!

- And last but not least, we localized an airport (because our Account Managers like to travel a lot) within the 20km range, so they just need to take a taxi or an uber and they'll be there in less than 30 minutes!
